The following is a set of topics that must be clarified to create the poster:

1) Boltzmann Colission operator
2) Boltzmann equations derivation and it's connection with the Liouville's equations of evolution
3) Isothermal equation of state and why it is used to relate pressure and density in the LBM (p=c_{s}^{2}\rho)
4) What is the lattice speed of sound and how to deduce it's expression from the theory
5) Find the article "Boltzmann Approach to Lattice Gas Simulations" by F. J. HIGUERA and J. JIMENEZ
6) How to deduce the relation between the kinematic vicosity and the time of relaxation (\nu = (1/3)(\tau - (1/2))(h^{2}/(\delta t)))
7) How deduce that the solution converges with order (Ma)^{2} , where Ma is the computational Mach number.
8) Why does the isothermal state equation implies that the incompressibility is only partially satisfied
9) How to deduce between the real viscosity and the lattice viscosity, and why is stable the simluation if the fluid is more viscous.
10) How is a Force introduced in the Collision operator and why the momentum is calculated in a different way?
11) Why the normalization of the density function (0<f^{\sigma}_{i}<1) implies that 0<\alpha^{\sigma}<1?
